      %p I made this site because I wanted a place to save photos, things I write, songs I record, videos I make, and other stuff like that. I've grown tired of switching from Myspace to Facebook to Twitter to Instagram to iCloud to whatever. I wanted one place to archive and share the digital stuff I want to keep. Rather than host this stuff on a 3rd party service, I built this. It's mostly HTML and CSS generated by a simple Rails app because I like the Rails toolchain. I'm betting that these formats will still work when I'm old. Get the source code for this site #{ link_to 'here', 'https://github.com/leemcalilly/mcalilly'}.
