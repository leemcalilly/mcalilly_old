    %p I moved to Jacksonville because I was ready to get out of NYC and back down in the South. It was supposed to be temporary, but ended up lasting two years. Zach and I had started working on what would become Original Fuzz and we needed to be in the same place to germinate that idea, so I moved into his apartment in Riverside. At first I was still working for The CFO Alliance, my last employer in NYC. They allowed me to continue working remotely down there. I eventually quit that job and worked at my first true design agency, Wingard Creative. Highlights in Jacksonville included riding my bike everywhere, purchasing my 1994 Ford F-150 for $1,200, Bold Bean coffee, surfing (I was in the water with two sharks the summer of 2012), halloween shows with Baby Sweat, jamming at the bloodpit, Dylan Fest, One Spark, and meeting Ariana.
